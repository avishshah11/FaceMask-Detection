<h1 align="center">Face Mask Detection</h1>

### About Project
Face Mask Detection built with PyTorch using Deep Learning specifically CNN have an accuracy of 98.04% trained on a custom architecture. It can 
even detect multiple faces with or without mask in a single image.

## :file_folder: Dataset
The dataset used can be downloaded from here - [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/omkargurav/face-mask-dataset).
Dataset is divided into two folder labeled 'with_mask' and 'without_mask' having around 3725 and 3828 images respectively.


## :key: Results
#### Our model gave 98.04% training accuracy for Face Mask Detection.

#### Below is the curve plot of Training Loss we got during training the model.
